            <p>I'm a twenty something designer based in Brussels. With a Master's degree in Architecture (MA) <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/">from Técnico Lisboa</a>. I am a big advocate for the union of IT and art, development and design. I believe in multidisciplinary teams and diverse work environments as the most prolific and that's where I see myself working. Most importantly I am passionate about helping create great products that matter to users.</p>
